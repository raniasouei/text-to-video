# Text-to-Video Colab

Generate videos from text prompts using state-of-the-art open-source AI models. This project features Google Colab notebooks for running **Text2Video-Zero** and **ModelScope Text-to-Video 1.7B**, making it easy to explore text-to-video generation workflows.

## Features

- **Text2Video-Zero**: Generate videos from textual descriptions without fine-tuning.
- **ModelScope T2V (1.7B)**: Lightweight yet powerful model for fast video generation.
- **Colab-ready**: Fully executable in Google Colab, no local setup needed.
- **Zero to Video**: From prompt to animation in minutes.

## Requirements

- Google Colab (GPU runtime recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies like `transformers`, `diffusers`, `torch`, `accelerate`, etc.  
  *(All dependencies are installed within the notebooks.)*

## Getting Started

1. Open a notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Enter your text prompt.
4. Preview or download your generated video.
